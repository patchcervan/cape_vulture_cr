# This function will load a raster covariate centred at the location x.
# The extent of the raster will be given by the argument av_area if provided.
# Otherwise a buffer argument may be provided to take a buffer around the colony.
# Note that the function requires x to be in latitude/longitude and therefore
# the buffer will not be accurate. It can be passed in meters rather than degrees
# and a rough conversion of 0.00001Â° = 1.11 m will be performed internally.
