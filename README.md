GPS tracking data that include both location and altitude will be used to examine the variables that explain 3D space use. Specifically, we will build a model to explore variables that are likely to influence the use of the rotor swept area of wind turbines; i.e. flight at collision risk height.

These variables include topography, the interaction of topography with local meteorology, distance to colony, distance to supplementary feeding site, and the land use or conservation status of an area. From this model (which is based at an individual level) we will then incorporate the different colony size to predict the overall level of risk of an area.
